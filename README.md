### Steps for using Vite:

1. Clone repo
2. In IntelliJ:
   1. Right Click project root folder (Stop-Motion-App) and select Open In --> Terminal
   2. Run the command "npm install" (installs dependencies for the server)
        - Note: If you haven't installed Node.js on your machine yet, now is the time to do so, otherwise you can't use Vite for developing :)
   4. Run the command "npm run dev" (starts your local Vite dev server and opens the browser)
